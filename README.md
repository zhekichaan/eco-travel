Project Overview:
This webpage was specially designed for an EcoTravel company. This page consists of a beautiful header, a simple but useful navigation bar, and a home section with a picture in an eco-travel style and some featured packages which user can click on. This webpage provides a user with detailed information about various travel destinations, durations, prices, and sustainability ratings in a well-crafted table with the function of highlighting the rows. There is a contact page where a user can leave a message to Eco Travel. Also each package in table is interactive and will show more info on click. At the end of the page, there is a footer with all the needed contact information, social media and copyright information.

This webpage highlights EcoTravel's commitment to responsible tourism by featuring destinations that promote environmental conservation, local cultures, and unique activities.
